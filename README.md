# Repository for the simulation part of the Quantum Computing Architecture and Electronics course

Welcome to QCA. This git provides you with a set of Python functions designed to simulate and analyze quantum control dynamics, based on the QuTiP library. You can make free use of the following functions that will serve as a baseline for working through the homework notebooks

## Getting Started
Before you dive into using these functions, please run the following line from your bash/command prompt:

!pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir qutip
